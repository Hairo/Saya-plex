Plex media server anime list updater (only hummingbird.me lists for now).

Currently supported file naming coventions (where XX is the episode count and [\*] can be (\*)):
- Title - XX.ext
- [Group] Title - XX.ext
- Title - XX [Media data].ext
- [Group] Title - XX [Media data].ext
- [text][Group][text] Title - XX [text][Media data][text].ext

TODO:
- myanimelist.net support
- Dual list support (update both HB and MAL lists at the same time)
- ~~Support for most of the file naming conventions~~
- Movies/OVAs/ support
- A GUI? (QT or wxWidgets probably)
- An indicator?
